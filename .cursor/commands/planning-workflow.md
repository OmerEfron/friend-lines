Create a detailed implementation plan for this feature, focusing on clarity, simplicity, and standard best practices.

Requirements:
- Use a git workflow: create a new feature branch, with separate sub-branches for each discrete task or change. Each sub-branch should be merged back into the feature branch after review. Only merge to main after all work is complete and verified.
- Utilize context7 for the latest documentation and to guide your implementation, keeping all documentation and code up to date with best practices.
- Follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle—solutions must be straightforward, conventional, and maintainable. Avoid unnecessary complexity or hacks.
- For UI/UX, research state-of-the-art apps with similar functionality using reputable resources and context7. Emphasize user-friendliness: the workflow must be self-explanatory and easy for any user to follow.

Process steps:
1. Conduct initial research: leverage web sources and context7 to gather best practices for UI/UX and technical requirements for similar applications.
2. Review the codebase to identify current structure, available components, and integration points.
3. Draft a step-by-step plan outlining architectural structure, necessary components, development milestones, and testing strategy.
4. List out each sub-task along with its corresponding git operation (branching, merging).
5. Ensure all work aligns with simple, standard engineering and UX conventions, documenting decisions as you proceed.
